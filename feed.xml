<h4 class="detail_intro__Hjqqa">Introduction: Getting started with an electronics project? You need to look into jlc's ecosystem</h4>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Today, many hobbyists are learning PCB design to create their own electronic boards. <strong>PCBs are more affordable than ever,</strong> which motivates many makers to learn PCB design. This wouldn't have been possible even 20 years ago.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My PCB design adventure began in 2019 with an <a href="Introduction: Getting started with an electronics project? You need to look into jlc's ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online tutorial</a>. I ordered the PCBs from JLCPCB and the parts from LCSC. JLCPCB had just launched their assembly service, but I still got the parts separately just for the adventure of soldering those smd parts. It was a great experience getting the design become a reality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If it was the 90s or even the early 2000s, I wouldn't have bothered with PCB design. It was way too expensive, and manufacturers weren't interested in small-time makers like us. It's the same reason we don't really do IC design now - the cost to get a wafer made is crazy high (and that’s not even counting slicing it up and packaging the chips), Selling a kidney might not be enough.<br></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hopefully, things will change when some fab starts doing prototype orders for hobbyists like us. IC design software has come a long way, so maybe by 2030 we can get our own custom ICs - that would be awesome.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Back to the present: If you're a hobbyist looking to create your own PCBs, it's now possible to design and get them made in under a month. You'll need some basic electronics knowledge and familiarity with components like transistors, resistors, and capacitors. Working with the ICs is no problem - we just refer to the datasheets. Fun fact: I designed my first PCB without even knowing how crystals worked! The point is, you only need to know enough to get started; nobody's an expert right away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Before diving in, lets familiarize these terms</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>EDA</strong> - Electronic Design Automation (PCB design software)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>DRC</strong> - Design Rule Check</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>DFM</strong> - Design For Manufacturing</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>PCBA</strong> - Printed Circuit Board Assembly</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>THT</strong> - Through Hole Technology</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>SMT</strong> - Surface Mount Technology</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>SMD</strong> - Surfact Mount Device</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">From PCB design to fabrication - here's how you can make it <strong>cost-effective</strong> and <strong>warp-speed</strong> your development time.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">1) Free Software First</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><img loading="lazy" src="https://image.easyeda.com/oshwhub/pullImage/1f80da5baebe4f48abc5f4890ec6b309.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" data-is-external-image="true"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When starting with PCB design, free software is the way to go. <strong>EasyEDA</strong> (cloud-based) and <strong>KiCad</strong> (open source) are the best options. For beginners, I recommend EasyEDA due to its user-friendly interface. Once you get the hang of PCB design, you can switch to KiCad or any other software - the core skills will transfer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I personally use EasyEDA for my open-source projects because its fully integrated with JLCPCB &amp; LCSC, which is where our members usually get our boards. Since the files end up at JLCPCB anyway, I'm not worried about using their cloud storage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">That said, You can also use Kicad - It's a <strong>fantastic open-source option</strong> that's constantly getting better. And if you like working with JLCPCB, there are some great open-source tools like <a href="https://github.com/uPesy/easyeda2kicad.py">easyeda2kicad</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Bouni/kicad-jlcpcb-tools">kicad-jlcpcb-tools</a> to make things easier.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">2) Manufacturer Capabilities</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><img loading="lazy" src="https://image.easyeda.com/oshwhub/pullImage/a3a99ddc1afd4585bd73d639e24234e7.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" data-is-external-image="true"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When designing a PCB, follow your manufacturer's capacilities (reference: <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/pcb-capabilities">JLCPCB</a>, <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/capabilities.html">PCBWay</a>, <a href="https://www.nextpcb.com/pcb-capabilities">NextPCB</a>). <strong>Set your software's DRC to match these rules</strong>; it will then flag any violations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">These specifications generally result in faster production and lower costs:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">FR4 board</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">2,4 layer</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">1.2, 1.6mm board thickness</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Vias 0.3mm or larger, smaller vias increase cost.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Green color soldermask</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">3) Start with Hand-Solderable parts</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://image.easyeda.com/oshwhub/pullImage/f46fcf2ce6554036b999d2b7b882e84b.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="400" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #7e8c8d;">image source: <a href="https://core-emt.com/smd-size-chart">https://core-emt.com/smd-size-chart</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When starting with SMD components, choose larger, hand-solderable sizes for <strong>easier rework</strong>. Avoid packages smaller than <strong>0603</strong> or those with hidden leads like <strong>QFNs</strong> and <strong>BGAs</strong>, as these are difficult to rework manually. Once you gain experience, you can move to smaller packages. While smaller components are often slightly cheaper, the difference is negligible for small quantities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In general, <strong>prefer SMD components over through-hole</strong>. They are typically less expensive, especially for PCB assembly service.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">4) The Cost-Benefit of PCB Assembly</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" src="https://image.easyeda.com/oshwhub/pullImage/884f4a3d9bd14a4c93f25a5eb235f453.png" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Many manufacturers now offer <strong>affordable assembly</strong> (PCBA). For example, JLCPCB's assembly cost is only around $8-$25 for 5-10 boards.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Depending on the complexity of your design, this can save you around 20-60 minutes of soldering time per board. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Unless you want to manually reflow them or practice hand-soldering SMDs, just get your boards assembled.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Double-sided assembly</strong> is considerably <strong>more expensive</strong>, usually costing 2-4 times more; as it adds an <strong>extra production step</strong> and requires a <strong>custom assembly fixture</strong>. For most designs, you should be able to pack the parts onto a single side.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Other than the time-cost benefit, Sometimes getting <strong>PCBA can be cheaper</strong> than getting the bare boards and components separately. Just look up why some governments have less import tax for Assembled PCB compared to bare PCB - use that to your advantage.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">- JLCPCB's ecosystem -</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The previous tips were general to all PCB manufacturers. Now we will see how to optimize costs even more, specific to JLCPCB.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Stick with <strong>"Economic" PCBA </strong>for prototypes. The "Standard" option is only needed for <strong>fine-pitch parts</strong> and special components.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Use components from the <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/parts"><strong>JLCPCB parts</strong></a> library, they can be assembled using their PCBA service</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Pick <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/parts/basic_parts"><strong>basic/preferred parts</strong></a> for passives since Extended components are charged $3 extra.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As of March 2025, JLCPCB has great deals for 4 and 6 layer prototypes also. That's a great excuse to try it out.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Funding Your Open-Source Hardware:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The OSHWLab Stars initiative offers valuable prototyping support for open-source hardware projects. You can find more details in <strong><a href="https://oshwlab.com/article/open-source-projects">this article</a></strong>.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ultimate Advantage:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">JLCPCB's access to components from its sister company - LCSC, gives them a significant advantage over competitors, particularly for assembled PCBs. Nowadays bare PCB production is fast across most manufacturers. But <strong>Component sourcing time</strong> is the bottleneck, it can take an extra 1-3 weeks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">JLCPCB has zero Component sourcing time if you use parts from their library. The whole production (including assembly) typically takes less than a week for 2-6 layer boards.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This highly integrated supply chain allows them to provide the <strong>best lead time</strong> at the most <strong>affordable rates</strong>. This allowed them to capitalize on the <strong>price elasticity of demand</strong> by triggerring substantial demand from hobbyists and small businesses. Like I said before, I wouldnt have gotten into PCB design if it werent for these companies.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>- Taking Your Project to Market -</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Once you've completed prototyping and built a following, you may find there's demand for your product. What started as a <strong>hobby project</strong> could become a <strong>marketable product</strong>. You may not have expected this, but some people will want to buy <strong>your product, from you</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Whether you plan to sell bare <strong>PCBs</strong>, <strong>DIY kits</strong>, or fully <strong>Assembled devices</strong>, you'll need to consider additional services like <strong>kitting</strong> (packaging components together) and <strong>subassembly</strong> (assembling parts of the product). Also learn about DFM. This journey can be a wild ride, you'll get valuable learning experiences and the potential for a side hustle.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Important considerations:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I use JLCPCB, so this article is biased in their favor. The focus here is on fast and affordable PCB prototyping. If you have a better alternative, let me know.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The sales reps from various PCB companies say that their QC is better so they can't match with jlc's prices (for low volume orders), is it true? We will find out.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Based on the assumption that most hobbyists would be sharing their projects with the community, I have recommended EasyEDA. If you're working on some secret stuff, then I don't have to say the obvious ;)</span></li>

                    <p><img src="https://blog.rambros3d.com/media/posts/3/Article1-thumb2.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <h4>Introduction: Are you making an Open Source Electronics project - then you need to check out OSHWLab Stars!</h4>
<p>In early 2024, I found out about the OSHWLab Stars initiative, which provides <strong>prototyping support</strong> for <strong>open-source projects</strong>. Here, I'll share my experience with OSHWLab Stars and explore its purpose and beneficiaries, helping you decide if <strong>you should apply</strong>.</p>
<h2>EasyEDA Pro edition:</h2>
<p>I designed my first PCB in 2019 using EasyEDA; learnt PCB design from a video of <strong>Electronoobs</strong>. Back then there was only EasyEDA, no pro edition.</p>
<p>I initially avoided OSHWLab Stars in early 2023 since the Pro edition of EasyEDA was buggy - barely usuable. So I <strong>designed the TrackLink V1 in the basic edition</strong> itself.</p>
<p>By mid-2024, most issues were resolved. then I designed the <a href="https://oshwlab.com/rambros/nano-8316-motor-driver"><strong>MICROSPORA</strong></a> board (6-layer) and applied for Stars.</p>
<p>As of January 2025, the software is running smoothly. Kudos to the EasyEDA team for their <strong>rapid bug fixes</strong> - Great job guys!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://image.easyeda.com/oshwhub/pullImage/ada8cfa1537c425d9519cec9333e7d07.png" width="974" height="47" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p>EasyEDA, being closed-source and cloud-based, carries the usual risks of vendor lock-in and privacy. Its strong ties to LCSC and JLCPCB suggest the free version will be there forever, as it serves as a promo to their services. I personally dont know anyone who uses the paid edition, I wonder who uses it - If you're a paid user, comment below; I would like to know about it.</p>
<p>For open-source projects, file storage on their servers isn't an issue given their public nature. With that addressed, let's proceed</p>
<h2>About OSHWLab Stars:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We invite all electronics enthusiasts to participate in the event and share your open-source hardware designs.<br>We provide free PCB prototyping, 3D printing, CNC machining, and a series of other services. We invite you to create and share with us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're developing an open-source project, this can be helpful to you.</p>
<p><strong>The requirements are simple:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide <strong>all source files</strong> to ensure the project is replicable.</li>
<li>Design the PCB using <strong>EasyEDA Pro</strong>.</li>
<li>You can receive funding for only <strong>one project</strong> at a time.</li>
<li>Project entries <strong>cannot be withdrawn</strong> after funding is granted.</li>
<li>Create a project with a <strong>real use</strong>. Dev boards are typically not approved.</li>
<li>Projects must be safe and <strong>cause no harm</strong> (avoid hazardous or lethal designs).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other things you should know:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You retain copyright</strong> of your project (as it's open source, you cannot withdraw it).</li>
<li>Funding covers services <strong>exclusively from JLCPCB</strong> (PCB, PCBA, 3D printing, CNC)</li>
<li>You are <strong>permitted to sell the products</strong> you receive through this initiative.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Do these terms hold up in practice?</h3>
<p>Yes, The OSHWLab team lives up to their promises. My experience with the <a href="https://oshwlab.com/rambros/nano-8316-motor-driver"><strong>MICROSPORA</strong></a> project was great. Approval was quick, and a minor issue with the JLCPCB coupon was also promptly resolved by the OSHWLab team. <strong>No contracts or complex agreements were required.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://image.easyeda.com/pullimage/3ZcHydSVclxexsREdUFUYgKuYsDcxLaZowadqIuo.jpeg" width="400" height="278" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p>Despite taking two weeks to finish the project write-up after receiving the boards. I only received an email to follow up on the project status, there was no pressure from their team - I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Then I applied for the next project - <strong><a href="https://oshwlab.com/rambros/rambros-tracklink">TrackLink V2.</a> </strong>It was the updated version of the original <strong><a href="https://oshwlab.com/rambros/dragon-railway-s3">TrackLink V1</a>. </strong>Like before, the whole process was very smooth. I received the boards as expected.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://image.easyeda.com/oshwhub/pullImage/144d9e8d28cb4f8fb725482ccf3b04ef.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<h3>Here's the real catch:</h3>
<p>Since my designs are relatively simple, it usually works well first time and no further revisions are required. But this time there was a <strong>small error</strong> in the design, a feature was not working as expected.</p>
<p>So naturally I applied for another coupon. Only then I got to know that this funding is provided only once for a project; this looks like an unwritten rule, it caught me by surprise since prototyping usually takes a few revisions.</p>
<p>It would be nice if we can mention the expected number of revisions in the application; it would increase transparency between the designer and oshwlab.</p>
<h2>Who benefits from OSHWLab Stars?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Project creator</li>
<li>The Open Source community</li>
<li>JLCPCB Company</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>You get valuable prototyping support for your open source project,</li>
<li>More projects are added to the Open Source community.</li>
<li>JLCPCB also benefits, as EasyEDA and OSHWLab belong to them.</li>
</ol>
<p>My community members order my designs directly from JLCPCB. So far so great, they are satisfied with our designs and JLCPCB's quality.</p>
<h4>You make a project - you share it with the community - they order the boards from JLCPCB.</h4>
<h2>Thats a WIN-WIN-WIN</h2>
<p>Check out my PCB designs on <strong><a href="https://oshwlab.com/rambros/works">OSHWLab</a></strong></p>
<h4>Notes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>I think OSHWLab can make this process even more simple by integrating a <strong>"one click order"</strong> button so that our members don't have to mess with the PCB and SMT settings when they order our boards. (One of our member ordered the PCBs without the SMT Assembly, Ouch!)</li>
<li>When you are applying for the Stars, make sure your design is completed first. Also it is easy to get approved if you have shared open source designs on OSHWLab previously.</li>
</ul>
